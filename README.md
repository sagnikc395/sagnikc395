# hey, i'm Sagnik 

i’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at UMass Amherst.

lately, I’ve been fascinated by how small language models reason — how we can help them think more reliably, and how fine-tuning them on ontologically diverse data might make them better at understanding complex, domain-specific questions, especially in medical QA.

i’ve been trying to get back into writing more regularly — sharing notes, ideas, and half-formed thoughts as I explore new papers and projects. Most of it’s open source, so feel free to check out my [blog / notes](https://sagnikc395.github.io/notes).
