# hey, this is Sagnik 

Hi ! I'm an upcoming Masters in Computer Science student in UMass, Amherst. 
My major research interests are in the domain of AI(especially NLP), Neuro Symbolic Programming and Program Synthesis ,
while I am also interested about other facets of Computer Science like Databases and Compilers, and I try to keep myself 
updated about major research in this areas from time-to-time.

## Current Projects:
- building the [Vanara Programming Language](https://sagnikc395.github.io/vanara-lang/) . 
- building a [redis] clone purely in Python from scratch to learn more about in-memory databases .
- cultivating a [digital garden](https://sagnikc395.github.io/notes/) of interconnected thoughts
