# hey, this is Sagnik 

i'm currently doing masters in computer science in UMass Amherst.

my current research interests are how to make reasoning better for small world models, and how 
we can fine tune small models to learn more ontologically diverse data and making them better 
for Medical QA.

currently trying to get back into writing and publishing my ideas and thoughts as much as possible and 
making it open source , checkout my notes on [things im reading / blog posts / ideas etc.](https://sagnikc395.github.io/notes).
